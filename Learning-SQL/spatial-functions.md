# Spatial functions

## Overview
This SQL script focuses on the manipulation and analysis of geospatial data using PostgreSQL and the PostGIS extension.
It includes the creation of tables for points, lines, and polygons, as well as various spatial queries and operations.

## Tables
1. **Points**: Stores point geometries with associated IDs.
2. **Lines**: Contains linestring geometries with associated IDs.
3. **Polygons**: Stores polygon geometries with associated IDs.

## Setup
1. Create tables for points, lines, and polygons.
2. Insert sample geometries into the respective tables.

## Spatial Queries
1. Retrieve all records from points, lines, and polygons tables.
2. Perform spatial operations such as calculating areas, centroids, lengths, bounding boxes, and distances.
3. Explore spatial relationships, including containment, intersections, convex hulls, and more.

## Prerequisites
- PostgreSQL with the PostGIS extension installed.

## Usage
1. Execute the SQL script in a PostgreSQL environment.
2. Modify the script or database structure as needed.

## Geospatial Operations
1. Calculate area, centroid, length, bounding box, and distance for different spatial entities.
2. Perform operations like buffer creation, finding differences, convex hull determination, and checking spatial relationships.
3. Utilize advanced operations like finding the closest point on a line, checking parallelism, and more.

## Notes
- Ensure the correct installation and configuration of PostgreSQL and PostGIS.
- Modify the script to suit specific geospatial analysis needs.
